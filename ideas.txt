Ideas for Networking Practice

: Combination of Systems Logger and Server
 - Send system data gathered via systems logger 
 - Enable me to ping the server from my phone, to get update on system stats from wherever I am


- Server format is the same as if it was done over local
 - the server shouldn't necessarily care where it is connecting to, just that it is sending data
 
- Systems Logger component
 - Already have the architecture for this via my Systems-Logger for the Raspberry Pi
 - Place data into a struct for transmission
